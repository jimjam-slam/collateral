Map complex operations `safely` or `quietly` (or both!), quickly see the captured side effectsand quickly spot and isolate captured side effects.

The `collateral` package extends the power of [`purrr`'s side effect-capturing functions](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/safely.html), giving you:

* drop-in `map()` variants, allowing you to capture side effects from functions mapped over lists, vectors and list-columns;
* fancy tibble output, allowing you to see which rows delivered errors or side effects; and
* helpers for summarising side effects or filtering tibbles and lists for present side effects.

If you're not familiar with `purrr` or haven't used a list-column workflow in R before, the [`collateral` vignette](https://rensa.co/collateral/articles/collateral.html) shows you how it works, the benefits for your analysis and how `collateral` simplifies the process of handling complex mapped operations.

If you're already familiar with `purrr`, the [tl;dr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Too_long;_didn%27t_read) is that [`collateral::map_safely()` and `collateral::map_quietly()` (and their `map2` and `pmap` variants)](https://rensa.co/collateral/reference/collateral_mappers.html) will automatically wrap your supplied function in `safely()` or `quietly()` and will provide enhanced `print()`ed output and tibble displays. You can then use the [`has_*()`](https://rensa.co/collateral/reference/has.html) and [`tally_*()`](https://rensa.co/collateral/reference/tally.html) functions to filter or summarise the returned tibbles or lists.

## Installation

You can install `collateral` on CRAN:

```r
install.packages('collateral')
```

Or install the development version using  [`devtools`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html):

```r
devtools::install_github('rensa/collateral')
```

## Example

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(collateral)

test =
  # tidy up and trim down for the example
  mtcars %>%
  rownames_to_column(var = "car") %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  select(car, cyl, disp, wt) %>%
  # spike some rows in cyl == 4 to make them fail
  mutate(wt = dplyr::case_when(
    wt < 2 ~ -wt,
    TRUE ~ wt)) %>%
  # nest and do some operations quietly()
  nest(-cyl) %>%
  mutate(qlog = map_quietly(data, ~ log(.$wt)))

test
```

`collateral` uses `pillar` to style output, so supported terminals will also color the output! -->
