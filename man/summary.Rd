\title{Summarise mapped side effects.}
\usage{
\method{summary}{safely_mapped}(object, ...)

\method{summary}{quietly_mapped}(object, ...)

\method{summary}{peacefully_mapped}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{safely_mapped} or \code{quietly_mapped} list to summarise.}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed to \code{summary()}.}
}
\value{
A named vector containing counts of the components named in
\code{\link[=map_safely]{map_safely()}}.
}
\description{
The \code{summary()} method for a \code{safely_mapped} or \code{quietly_mapped}
list (or list-column) prints out the total number of elements (rows), as well
as the number that each returned results and errors (for
\code{safely_mapped}) or returned results, output, messages and warnings (for
\code{quietly_mapped}). It also invisibly returns a named vector with these
counts.
}
\details{
Although the output can be used in tidy workflows (for automated testing, for
example), tally functions like \code{\link[=tally_results]{tally_results()}} tend to be more
convenient for this purpose.

Importantly, the \code{summary()} method tells you how many elements were
returned a type of side effect, \emph{not the number of those side
effects}. Some list elements might return more than one warning, for
example, and these are not counted separately.
